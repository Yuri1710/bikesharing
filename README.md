We analyze data in these challenge from the Citi Bike program in New York City, were we created visualizations that showed the length of time that bikes were checked out for all riders and genders, the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week, and the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week. Our goal is to attract potential investors to our business proposal.
